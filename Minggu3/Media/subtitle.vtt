00:00:21.000--> 00:00:22.000 size:50%
I was on my own

00:00:23.000--> 00:00:24.000 size:50%
Speaking to the wall

00:00:26.000--> 00:00:28.000 size:50%
on 16th floor

00:00:29.000--> 00:00:31.000 size:50%
feeling so alone

00:00:31.000--> 00:00:33.000 size:50%
the rain starts to fall

00:00:34.000--> 00:00:36.000 size:50%
then i wrote a song

00:00:37.000--> 00:00:39.000 size:50%
the day getting older

00:00:40.000--> 00:00:42.000 size:50%
but i still have hope

00:00:43.000--> 00:00:45.000 size:50%
about a life that asked for more

00:00:46.000--> 00:00:48.000 size:50%
it's hard for sure

00:00:49.000--> 00:00:52.000 size:50%
i give my best and all

00:00:53.000--> 00:00:56.000 size:50%
life is like a war

00:00:57.000--> 00:01:00.000 size:50%
one thing that i know

00:01:01.000--> 00:01:04.000 size:50%
i don't wanna jump and fall

00:01:05.000--> 00:01:08.000 size:50%
so i'll keep flying up and high

00:01:09.000--> 00:01:10.000 size:50%
 keeping my dream up in the sky

00:01:11.000--> 00:01:12.000 size:50%
 no body getting me to the ground

00:01:13.000--> 00:01:21.000 size:50%
but if i do then i'm gonna stand up,up to the sky....

00:01:22.000--> 00:01:27.000 size:50%
up,up,to the sky

00:01:37.000--> 00:01:39.000 size:50%
the rain keeps on falling 

00:01:40.000--> 00:01:42.000 size:50%
pounding on my door

00:01:43.000--> 00:01:44.000 size:50%
i don't care what's coming 

00:01:45.000--> 00:01:46.000 size:50%
as long as i have hope

00:01:48.000--> 00:01:52.000 size:50%
about a life that asked for more

00:01:53.000--> 00:01:55.000 size:50%
it's hard for sure

00:01:56.000--> 00:01:59.000 size:50%
i give my best and all

00:02:00.000--> 00:02:02.000 size:50%
life is like a war

00:02:03.000--> 00:02:05.000 size:50%
one thing that i know 

00:02:06.000--> 00:02:09.000 size:50%
i don't wanna jump and fall

00:02:10.000--> 00:02:12.000 size:50%
over and over again

00:02:13.000--> 00:02:14.000 size:50%
so i'll keep flying up and high

00:02:15.000--> 00:02:16.000 size:50%
keeping my dream up in the sky

00:02:17.000--> 00:02:19.000 size:50%

00:02:20.000--> 00:02:25.000 size:50%
